                <h3>What is burger?</h3>
                <p>A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor.  
                    Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular. In India, vegetarian burgers are created using potato and mint instead of a meat patty. 
                    Regardless of its content, a burger should always be properly cooked to be safe. Rare burgers carry the risk of bacterial infection and food poisoning.</p>

                <p>Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
                    The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.In 2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
